# CNC
this is a project based on Cyclone PCB Factory https://github.com/carlosgs/Cyclone-PCB-Factory
Changed the hardware (MSP430) & Software. Add a 3.2"TFT User Interface and SD card in order to be independet from PC.
Still a lot to do. This is the first version and there are still some things to change in software.
